\label{sec:dust-fluid-flux}

A fluid is a material which flows, that is, has forces perpendicular
to some imaginary surface which are much greater than the forces
parallel to it. A perfect fluid is the limit where the substance has
pressure but zero stress.

Dust is an idealised form of matter consisting of a collection of
non-interacting particles which are not moving relative to
one-another, and so the collection has zero pressure. Thus there is a
momentarily comoving reference frame (MCRF) with respect to which all
of the particles have zero velocity. 
If all of the particles have the same rest mass, $m$, but the cloud of
dust may have a varying mass density, $n$.

Transforming to a frame movig at a velocity $\vec{v}$ to the MCRF then
the stationary volume element $\Delta x \Delta y \Delta z$ will be
Lorentz contracted to $\Delta x' \Delta y' \Delta z' = (\Delta x /
\gamma) \Delta y \Delta z$, for relative motion along the $x$-axis,
increasing the number density to $n \gamma$, producing a flux through
the area $\Delta y \Delta z$. All the particles pass through $\Delta
y' \Delta z'$ in a time $\Delta t'$ for $\Delta x' = v \Delta t'$, so
the total number of particles is
\[ (\gamma n) (v \Delta t') \Delta y' \Delta z' \]
This produces an $x$-directed flux,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:76}
  N^x = \gamma n v^x
\end{equation}
or, defining a flux vector, $\vec{N}$, and letting $\vec{U} = (\gamma,
\gamma v^x, \gamma v^y, \gamma v^z)$ be the velocity 4-vector,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:77}
  \vec{N} = n \vec{U}
\end{equation}
In the MCRF $\vec{U} = (1, \vec{0})$, so $g(\vec{U}, \vec{U}) = -1$ so
\[ g(\vec{N}, \vec{N}) = N_{\alpha} N^{\alpha} = -n^2 \]
The components of the flux vector $\vec{N}$ in the frame are then
\[ \vec{N} = ( \gamma n, \gamma n \vec{v} ) \] Any function
$\phi(t,x,y,z)$ over spacetime defines a constant surface, and its
gradient $\of{\dd}{\phi}$ defines a normal to the surface. The unit normal gradient is defined
\[ \of{n} \equiv \frac{\of{\dd{}}{\phi}}{\abs{\of{\dd{}}{\phi}}} \]
Contracting this with the flux vector gives the flux across the
corresponding surface.
