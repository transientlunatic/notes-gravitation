\label{sec:parall-curv-surf}

A differentiable manifold has no concept of parallelism between
vectors defined at two points. An affine connection provides a rule to
provide such a concept. Consider transporting a vector across the
surface of a sphere from a pole to the equator, keeping it tangent to
the sphere at all times, without rotating it as it is
transported. Then transporting the vector 90 degrees around the
equator, and returning to the pole, we find the vector rotated by 90
degrees; clearly there is no global concept of parallelism. So we
define a rule for conducting this transport in a parallel fashion.

\section{Covariant Derivative}
\label{sec:covariant-derivative}

Suppose we have a curve, $C$, and a connection. The tangent to $C$ is
$U = \dv{\lambda}$, and we have a vector $V$ from the tangent space
$T_P$ at $P$. By parallel-transporting $V$ along the curve we generate
a new vector field, and as this does not change along the curve, the
curve's derivative with respect to the field is zero, so
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:41}
  \nabla_U V = 0
\end{equation}
If $W$ is a vector field defined everywhere along $C$ then its
covariant derivative can be defined in a similar way to Lie
derivatives, 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:42}
  ( \nabla_U W)_P = \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \frac{W_{\lambda_0 + \epsilon}(\lambda_0) - W(\lambda_0)}{\epsilon}
\end{equation}
where $W_{\lambda_0+\epsilon}$ is the parallel transported field which
equals $W$ at the point $\lambda_0+\epsilon$. The operation of
transportation is not the same as the dragging-back of the Lie
derivative, which requires the whole congruence, and not just the
curve. The $\nabla_U$ object is a differential operator:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:43}
  \nabla_U (fW) = f \nabla_U W + W \nabla_U f = f \nabla_U W + W \dv{f}{\lambda}
\end{equation}
It can be extended to tensors of arbitrary type by the Leibniz rules,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:44}
  \nabla_U (A \otimes B) = (\nabla_U A) \otimes B + A \otimes (\nabla_U B)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:45}
  \nabla_U \langle \of{\omega}, A \rangle = \langle \nabla_U \of{\omega}, A \rangle + \langle \of{\omega}, \nabla_U A \rangle
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}

Now suppose the parameter along the curve is changed from $\lambda$ to
$\mu$, so the new tangent is $gU$, for $g = \dv{\lambda}{\mu}$, then
\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:46}
  \nabla_{gU} W = g \nabla_U W
\end{equation}
We also require
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:47}
(\nabla_U W)_P +(\nabla_V W)_P = (\nabla_{U+V} W)_P
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}
The fact that $\nabla W$ is a tensor field---the gradient of $W$
allows the curve can be removed from the definition of the covariant
derivative.

\section{Covariant derivatives of a basis}
\label{sec:covar-deriv-basis}

Any tensor may be described as a linear combination of basis tensors,
which can be derived from basis vectors, and the connection can be
retrieved from knowledge of the gradients of the basis vectors, so we
define
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:48}
  \nabla_{e_i} e_j = \tensor{\Gamma}{^k_{ji}} e_k
\end{equation}
with the symbol $\tensor{\Gamma}{^k_{ji}}$ the Christoffel symbols;
for fixed $(i,j)$ this is the $k$th component of the vector field
$\nabla_i e_j$, defining $\nabla_i \equiv \nabla_{e_i}$. These
completely determine the connection, although are not the components
of a tensor.

Knowing the derivatives of the basis vectors, for an arbitrary tensor, with $U=\dv{\lambda}$, then
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:49}
  \nabla_U V = U^i \nabla_{e_i}(V^j e_j) = U^i( \nabla_{e_i} V^j )e_j + U^i V^j \nabla_{e_i} e_j
\end{equation}
given that $V^j$ is a function, $U^i \nabla_i (V^j) =
\dv{V^j}{\lambda}$, so
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:50}
  \nabla_U V = \dv{V^j}{\lambda} e_j + U^i V^j \tensor{\Gamma}{^k_{ji}}e_k = \qty( \dv{V^j}{\lambda} + \tensor{\Gamma}{^j_{ki}} V^k U^i ) e_j
\end{equation}
If $e_i = \dv{\mu}$ then $\nabla_i (V^j) = \dv{V^j}{\mu}$, with $V^j$
function along the curve with parameter $\mu$, if $e_i = \pdv{x^i}$ is
a coordinate vector, then
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:51}
  \nabla_i V^j = \pdv{x^i} V^j = \tensor{V}{^j_{,i}}
\end{equation}
which introduces the comma notation for forms. Likewise we can
introduce the semicolon notation for a covariant derivative,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:52}
  \tensor{(\nabla V)}{^j_i} = \tensor{V}{^j_{,i}} + \tensor{\Gamma}{^j_{ki}} V^k = \tensor{V}{^j_{;i}}
\end{equation}

\section{Torsion}
\label{sec:torsion}

A connection is symmetric if the quantities $\comm{U}{V}$ and
$\nabla_UV - \nabla_V U$ are equal.
\[ \comm{U}{V} = \nabla_U V- \nabla_V U \]

For a non-symmetric connection we can define the torsion,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:53}
  \tensor{T}{^k_{ji}} e_k = \nabla_{e_j} e_j - \nabla_{e_j} e_i - \comm{e_i}{e_j}
\end{equation}

The symmetric part of the connection can be defined for any
connection:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:54}
  \tensor{\Gamma}{^k_{\rm (S)}_{ij}} = \tensor{\Gamma}{^k_{ij}} - \half \tensor{T}{^k_{ij}}
\end{equation}

\section{Geodesics}
\label{sec:geodesics}

A geodesic is a curve which parallel transports its own tangent
vector. The geodesic equation is 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:55}
  \nabla_U U = 0
\end{equation}
For $\lambda$ the parameter of the curve, and $\set{x^i}$ a coordinate system this becomes
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:56}
  \dv{U^i}{\lambda} + \tensor{\Gamma}{^i_{jk}} U^j U^k = \dv[2]{x^i}{\lambda} + \tensor{\Gamma}{^i_{jk}} \dv{x^j}{\lambda} \dv{x^k}{\lambda} = 0
\end{equation}
If the parameter of a curve is changed from $\lambda$ to $\mu = a
\lambda +b$, for $a$, $b$ constants, we find the parameter $\mu$ is
also a solution of the geodesic equation, and so a geodesic's
paramater is \emph{affine}.
