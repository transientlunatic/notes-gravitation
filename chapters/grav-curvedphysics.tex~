Recall the definition of the Ricci tensor and the Ricci scalar,
\begin{equation}
  \tag{\ref{eq:69}}
  \tensor{R}{_{\beta \nu}} = \tensor{g}{^{\alpha \mu}} \tensor{R}{_{\alpha \beta \mu \nu}} = \tensor{R}{^{\mu}_{\beta \mu \nu}}
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation}
  \tag{\ref{eq:70}}
  R = \tensor{g}{^{\beta \nu}} \tensor{R}{_{\beta \nu}}
\end{equation}
Note that the Ricci tensor is symmetric; by differentiating equation
\eqref{eq:67},
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:92}
  2 \tensor{R}{_{\alpha \beta \mu \nu, \lambda}} = \tensor{g}{_{\alpha \beta, \beta \mu \lambda}} - \tensor{g}{_{\alpha \mu, \beta \nu \lambda}} 
                                           +\tensor{g}{_{\beta \mu, \alpha \nu \lambda}} - \tensor{g}{_{\beta \nu, \alpha \mu \lambda}}
\end{equation}
Recalling that partial derivatives do commute,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:93}
  \tensor{R}{_{\alpha \beta \mu \nu, \lambda}} + \tensor{R}{_{\alpha \beta \lambda \mu, \nu}} + \tensor{R}{_{\alpha \beta \lambda, \mu}} = 0
\end{equation}
Since the Ricci tensor is derived in normal coordinates, where
$\Gamma^{\mu}_{\alpha \beta} = 0$, so partial and covariant
differentiation are equivalent, and so we get the Bianchi identities,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:93}
  \tensor{R}{_{\alpha \beta \mu \nu; \lambda}} + \tensor{R}{_{\alpha \beta \lambda \mu; \nu}} + \tensor{R}{_{\alpha \beta \lambda; \mu}} = 0
\end{equation}
Performing the Ricci contraction from equation \eqref{eq:69} on the
Bianchi identities,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:94}
  \tensor{R}{\beta \nu; \lambda} - \tensor{R}{_{\beta \lambda; \nu}} + \tensor{R}{^{\mu}_{\beta \nu \lambda; \mu}} = 0
\end{equation}
contracting these in turn,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:95}
  \tensor{G}{^{\alpha \beta}_{; \beta}} = 0
\end{equation}
which is the contracted Bianchi identity, with $\ten{G}$, the Einstein
tensor, defined
\begin{fequation}
  \tensor{G}{^{\alpha \beta}} = \tensor{R}{^{\alpha \beta}} - \half \tensor{g}{^{\alpha \beta}} R
\end{fequation}

\section{The equivalence principle}
\label{sec:equiv-princ}

One statement of the equivalence principle is
\begin{quotation}
  All local, freely falling, non-rotating laboratories are fully
  equivalent for the performance of all physical experiments.
\end{quotation}
This doesn't rule out the possibility that the complicated curvature
of spacetime somehow reduces in a locally inertial frame. To preclude
this we can reword the equivalence principle.
\begin{quotation}
  Any physical law which can be expressed in tensor notation in
  special relativity has exactly the same form in a locally inertial
  frame of curved spacetime.
\end{quotation}
This means that partial differentiation is basically just a special
case of covariant differentiation for a locally inertial frame, that
is, in tensor notation,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:96}
  \tensor{T}{^{\mu \nu}_{;\nu}} = 0
\end{equation}
This also tells us how matter is affected by spacetime; in SR a
particle moves along the timelike coordinate of a Minkowski diagram
when at rest, and from the strong equivalence principle this must be
the case with general relativity too; this picks out the curves
generated by the timelike coordinate of a locally inertial frame, that
is
\begin{quotation}
  Space tells matter how to move: free-falling particles move on
  timelike geodesics of the local spacetime.
\end{quotation}
