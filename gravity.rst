The physics of gravity

Thought experiments on gravitation
==================================

Gravitational redshift
----------------------

Imagine a particle of mass :math:`m` dropping through a distance
:math:`h`; the particle starts with energy :math:`E=m` and ends with
energy :math:`E=m+mgh`. We then send this back up to the first position,
where it has energy :math:`E'`. We know :math:`E'=m`, since we’d have a
way of making free energy otherwise! Thus

.. math:: E' = m = \frac{E}{1+gh}

Hence, travelling in a gravitational field causes photons to become
redshifted.

Schild’s photons
----------------

Imagine a photon with frequency :math:`f` fired from a point :math:`A`
to a point :math:`B` directly above it in a gravitational field. The
photon will be redshifted to a frequency :math:`f'`, and after some set
number of periods :math:`n` another photon is sent from a point (in
spacetime) :math:`A'` to :math:`B'`. The intervals :math:`AB` and
:math:`A'B'` are the same in all frames, but :math:`AA'` and :math:`BB'`
will vary due to the presence of a gravitaional field.

The falling lift
----------------

In special relativity an inertial frame is one where Newton’s laws hold,
so particles not affected by an external force move in straight lines.
Consider the situation of a locally inertial frame, where there are no
graviational forces. This occurs in free-fall. Objects in a locally
inertial frame stay at rest; if the inertial frame is accelerated then
the objects won’t be—they will increase their speed towards the floor of
the frame at the same rate as the accleration. This is similar to the
observation that all objects fall at the same rate in a gravitational
field; Einstein supposed that this was not a coincidence, and postulated
that:

    Uniform gravitational fields are equivalent to frames that
    accelerate uniformly relative to inertial frames. (Weak equivalence
    principle).

Consider a beam of light shining horizontally across an inertial frame;
the beam will end up at a point horizontally opposite where it’s
emitted, but as the frame is moving in the field in will have moved
relative to the torch, and in the frame the beam will appear to be bent
by the field.

Relativity and gravitation
==========================

Tides and geodesic deviation
----------------------------

Consider two particles, :math:`A` and :math:`B`, falling towards earth;
they start off level at a height :math:`z(t)` from the centre of the
earth, and separated by a distance :math:`\xi(t)`. :math:`z` and
:math:`\xi` are proportional, such that

.. math:: \xi(t) = k z(t)

The force on the particle of mass :math:`m` at an altitude :math:`z` due
to gravity is

.. math::

   \label{eq:74}
     F = G \frac{M m }{z^2}

 and so

.. math::

   \label{eq:75}
     \dv[2]{\xi}{t} = k \dv[2]{z}{t} = -k \frac{F}{m} = -k \frac{GM}{z^2} = - \xi \frac{GM}{z^3}

 Thus, as the particles fall they move towards each other.

There is no universal inertial frame
------------------------------------

In special relativity inertial frames have an infinite extent, but
consider two observers free-falling on opposite sides of the earth. Each
is inertial, but the second derivative of their mutual separation is
non-zero, so special relativity cannot explain what happens in one of
the frames relative to the other. Clearly it isn’t then possible for us
to, for example, observe matter falling into a black hole and understand
it with special relativity.

The theory of General Relativity introduces a principle of general
covariance:

    All physical laws must be invariant under all coordinate
    transformations.

Thus the approach of general relativity is to express all physics in a
coordinate-independent geometrical description.

Natural units
=============

In special relativity it is customary to use natural units, where
distance and time are both measured in metres, but in general relativity
we extend this to mass, to measure it in metres also. These are also
known as geometric, or geometrised units.
